Code explantion:

We did a double hasing impl of open addressing, Chris implemented a double hasing formula that prehashes and then prehashes
again to the mod of the sum of a hash function multiplied by i.

We start with a dictionary that double hashes all the keys. then inserting a new key value starts with checking if the table needs to be doubled,
and doing that first if that has to be done (with rehashing all the elements. then inserting the new element at the end.
